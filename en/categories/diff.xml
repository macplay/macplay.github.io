While there exist more specialized tools for comparing files, vimdiff has always worked well enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The inefficiency of the external diff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Vim’s diff mode was seriously lacking. This was basically because it needed to write down temporary files, shell out and run a manual diff command and parse the result back and as one can imagine, this could be slow and was seriously inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this required to have a diff binary available that was able to create &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Edit_script"&gt;ed like style diff&lt;/a&gt;, so one could not even fall-back to using git-diff (which is considered to have one of the best tested diff libraries and allows to select different algorithms) for creating those diffs. This lead to the creation of vimscript &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chrisbra/vim-diff-enhanced"&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt;, that would internally translate a unified diff back into an ed-like diff. Of course this would add an extra performance penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
